# Classification-Trees-in-Python

Scikit-learn and Cost Complexity Pruning are used to build a Classification Tree, which uses continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.

The following steps are followed:

1. Import Data from a File
2. Identify and Deal with Missing Data
3. Format the data for Decision Trees
4. Build a Preliminary Classification Tree
5. Use Cost Complexity Pruning to improve the Tree
6. Build, Evaluate, Draw and Interpret a final Tree
